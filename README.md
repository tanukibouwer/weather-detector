Adds a Weather Detector block that outputs a redstone signal based on the current weather.
The Weather Detector block: 
* Outputs a redstone signal of strength 1-8 if it's raining/snowing.
* Outputs a redstone signal of strength 9-15 if it's thundering.
* Can be inverted by interacting with it.

This version supports Fabric and Forge for 1.18.2. Fabric version requires Fabric API.
PRs and issues appreciated.
