# Weather Detector

![Weather Detector Icon](https://github.com/tanukibouwer/weather-detector/raw/main/asset_src/weather_detector_render.png)

Adds a Weather Detector block that outputs a redstone signal based on the current weather.
The Weather Detector block: 
* Outputs a redstone signal of strength 1-8 if it's raining/snowing.
* Outputs a redstone signal of strength 9-15 if it's thundering.
* Can be inverted by interacting with it.

Currently supports Fabric 1.19.3.
PRs and issues appreciated.
